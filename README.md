This is the Rock Paper Scissors project of Foundations of The Odin Project.
The goal of this project is to build a responsive webpage game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
In the first half of the project, I wrote some functions with knowledge learnt from JavaScript fundamentals so that one can play the game against the computer from console log.
In the second half of the project, I built the front end UI part by writing JavaScript functions for DOM manipulation.
